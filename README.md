# Real-Time E-Commerce Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is designed to implement a **real-time e-commerce recommendation system** that provides personalized product suggestions to users based on their browsing history, cart additions, and product interactions. The system uses **collaborative filtering** for existing users and **content-based filtering** for new users. The application is built with a modern stack using **React** for the frontend, **Supabase** for the backend, and **Python** for recommendation algorithms.

## Features

### 1. **User Management**
- **Login/Signup Page**: Secure authentication using email/password with Supabase as the backend to manage user credentials.
- **User Data Storage**: Persistent user data storage in Supabase for tracking user activity such as product views, cart additions, and clicks.
- **Session Persistence**: User activity data persists across sessions once a user logs in.

### 2. **Homepage**
- **Product Categories**: Display of products in various categories like **Electronics**, **Tech Gadgets**, **Clothing**, **Mobiles**, and **Utensils**.
- **Search Bar**: Search functionality for users to find specific products across categories.

### 3. **Cart Functionality**
- **Add/Remove Items from Cart**: Users can add products to their cart and modify the cart content.
- **Persistent Cart**: The cart data is stored in Supabase, linked to the user’s account, and persists across sessions.

### 4. **Recommendation System**
- **Collaborative Filtering**: For returning users, recommendations are generated based on user-item interactions such as views, clicks, and cart additions. Uses techniques like **Cosine Similarity** or **Matrix Factorization**.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: For new users, recommendations are based on product categories or keywords they interact with.
- **User Interaction Tracking**: Tracks interactions such as views, clicks, and cart additions to refine recommendations over time.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - **Cosine Similarity** for collaborative filtering.
  - **TF-IDF** or **Embedding Models** for content-based filtering.

### 5. **Product Catalog**
- A dataset of 100-200 unique products is generated with attributes such as:
  - Product Name
  - Category (Electronics, Tech Gadgets, Clothing, Mobiles, Utensils)
  - Price
  - Description
  - Image URL
  - Product ID

### 6. **Generating the Dataset**
- The dataset is generated using **Python** and **Faker** to create random product details (name, price, description, etc.).
- Product data is saved into **CSV** format or directly into the **Supabase** database for easy access.

### 7. **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React (or Angular) with **Material-UI** or **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive UI.
- **Backend**: **Supabase** for user authentication, database management, and storing user activity data.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Built with **Python** (libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**) for implementing collaborative and content-based filtering logic.
- **API**: The recommendation engine is integrated with the frontend via a **FastAPI** or **Flask** server.
- **Deployment**: The frontend is hosted on **Vercel** or **Netlify**, and the backend is managed with **Supabase**.

### 8. **User Journey**
- **New Users**: 
  - Signup → Homepage with generic product categories and initial recommendations.
  - Recommendations improve with user interactions over time (views, searches, cart additions).
- **Returning Users**:
  - Login → Homepage with personalized recommendations based on past activity (viewed products, cart items).
  - Prioritized recommendations from recently viewed or frequently interacted products.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Install the following tools:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account for backend services.
   
2. Install required dependencies:
   - For Frontend (React):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For Backend (Python):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Run the following command to start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup
1. Set up a **Supabase** project and configure the database schema to store user activity data.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory.
3. Run the server using **FastAPI** or **Flask** to integrate the recommendation engine with the frontend.

### Running the Application
Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can access the application by navigating to the localhost URL provided in the terminal.
